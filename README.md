# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This project uses the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset provided by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz and colleagues from the Smartlab, UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova. The dataset contains sensor signals from a group of volunteers performing six activities (e.g., walking, standing, laying) while wearing a smartphone. The goal of this project is to merge, clean, and organize the raw data into tidy formats, making it suitable for analysis.
